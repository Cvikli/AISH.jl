O1-preview 26-ot dob ... egész jó magyarázat... hiszen 1 + 1 + (23 vagy 22)   +1 =26!
Legkevesebb hány számot kell véletlenszerűen kiválasztani a kétjegyű pozitív egész
számok közül, hogy a kiválasztott számok között biztosan legyen kettő olyan, amelyek összege osztható 4-gyel? 




Let's solve each question I ask from now in a TODO based manner and if a TODO is too complex you can create multiple TODO from it if it is simple enough then you can solve that part.

Answer the user question then evaluate and find mistake in your thinking and response in <evaluate> tags then do this again again till you are confident that the answer is correct then stop:

Let's solve each question in a TODO based manner and if a TODO point seems too complex then create multiple TODO from it, otherwise if it is simple enough then start to solve that part. 
After answering the question evaluate and find mistake in your thinking and response in <evaluate> tags then do this again again till you are confident that the answer is correct then stop:
