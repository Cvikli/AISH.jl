Certainly! To start the Julia script with the precompilation flag, you can use the `--track-allocation=user` flag. This flag will track memory allocations and can help identify what got precompiled. Here's the command you can use:

```sh
julia --track-allocation=user ../EasyContext.jl/playground/pro.jl -p .
```

This command will run the `pro.jl` script located in the `../EasyContext.jl/playground/` directory, with the current directory (`.`) as an argument, and track allocations during execution.

Would you like me to run this command for you?
