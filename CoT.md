Standard works:

- Simplifing codebase
  - Removed unnecessary comments and whitespace.
  - Consolidated similar code structures.
  - Used more concise syntax where possible (e.g., inline functions for simple routes).
  - Removed redundant @show statements.
  - Simplified some variable assignments and conditionals.
